<p>Welcome to the second installment of Developer Spotlight! A series of blog articles where we talk to developers about how they use PlayCanvas and showcase the fantastic work they are doing on the Web.</p>
<p>Today we are excited to be joined by Frantz Lasorne, co-founder of <a href="https://www.vz777.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visionaries777</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hi! Let&#x27;s get started. Firstly, welcome to the developer spotlight! Frantz, if you could just tell me a little bit about yourself and your team and your studio.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Frantz and I&#x27;m the co-founder of Visionaries777. Actually, we [founders] are three. We started as two French guys. We studied together in France; Interaction Design, and then we created this company about 10 years ago in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[We currently employ] Around 35 people. We&#x27;ve been working on AR since 2010. It&#x27;s our main focus. Within the realm of AR, we are involved in 3D real time AR, and all sorts of XR applications.</p>
<p>Me and my business partner were working at Lego in Denmark before, so we started to work on AR back then in the R&amp;D department. We helped Lego bridge the physical and digital to create hybrid play experiences.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we left Lego and started our own company. Lego hired us as consultants to keep working for them for some time. In the early days, we did a lot of collaborations for marketing and promotional events using AR.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the things we work on are more industrial-focused; automotive or luxury. AR is now a properly matured product, with WebGL, Web AR experiences, VR and so on.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnoiJA7UCiY" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Thank you! I&#x27;m curious, why did Visionaries777 choose PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p>Before, we always used Unity 3D for any 3D real time project, because they have a huge compatibility of hardware platforms. It&#x27;s quite nice. The only platform they are lacking is the web.</p>
<p>We were looking around, trying to find what is the best platform to develop WebGL experiences. Then, we saw PlayCanvas, opened the editor, and were surprised how familiar it was for us. I think the people who designed the PlayCanvas editor knew Unity and got inspired in terms of the menu and layout. It&#x27;s very similar to the way [Unity] works. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s an editor on the web rather than a desktop application. So for us, it was very easy to do the jump.</p>
<p>So far we&#x27;ve been really happy with all the engine capabilities, the loading, how lightweight it is, et cetera. For us, it&#x27;s the best platform for developing web experiences.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/v777-husqvarna-f2011d5a97b9b1526426d5ffe8680bd7.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Husqvarna" src="/assets/images/v777-husqvarna-f2011d5a97b9b1526426d5ffe8680bd7.jpg" width="1600" height="884" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p><strong>Awesome! So, were there any initial challenges that you guys faced? How did you guys end up overcoming them?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of challenges? I think mostly the model optimizations; how to get the WebGL experience as small as possible, but retaining maximum visual quality. Most of our clients are either automotive brands or luxury brands, so they are concerned about the product that you are looking at on the screen. It&#x27;s pointless to show a product that you can see the rough edges of. They won&#x27;t like it in the end.</p>
<p>That was our struggle at the beginning - to try and find the right balance of optimizing enough, but not too much, and be happy with loading time. So it took some trying to get this right and find the right compromise.</p>
<p>Right now, with our current approach and the tools in our pipeline, we’re quite happy. And it&#x27;s also why we work with Cartier and are now doing all these products on their websites.</p>

<p><strong>That&#x27;s very interesting. Visionaries777 has worked on several Web AR experiences. Can you tell me how important you think Web AR is today?</strong></p>
<p>It&#x27;s very important - but we are back to the same problem that we had in the early 2010s, when we relied on markers for tracking. Now with where we are in WebAR we are still very limited. You need something like an image marker, or a floor with a world target, but it&#x27;s not as stable as if you use AR Kit or AR Core in a native Unity app.</p>
<p>With a standalone Unity application with ARKit and ARCore it&#x27;s mind blowing what you can do. There&#x27;s barely any drift, it&#x27;s super accurate. With web you&#x27;re still constrained. Tracking is not perfect. There&#x27;s a lot of drift. So I think the applications we see with the present state of tech are limited, experiences are considered a bit gimmicky. It&#x27;s getting there, but it still needs to grow.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, for marketing initiatives, no one wants to install an ad app on their smartphone as a user, as a consumer. You don&#x27;t want to install a BMW app just to uninstall it three days later because you&#x27;re done playing around.</p>
<p>These sorts of experiences were fine 10 years ago on an iPhone, but now people have moved on, and have different mindsets - things should be accessible through a web browser directly, not through an app. If it&#x27;s inside an app, it has to be inside Snapchat, inside Instagram, or inside an app that has more to it than just one AR experience.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/v777-bmw-80445262e2e58a12dbc7e8d94e893ff0.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="BMW" src="/assets/images/v777-bmw-80445262e2e58a12dbc7e8d94e893ff0.jpg" width="1024" height="563" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p><strong>Extending a bit from that question, why do you think that the clients you work with want Web AR in their experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Augmented reality has always been exciting for brands to show a product in 3D and also integrate it into [customers’] homes or their driveway. It’s quite appealing for a brand, marketing-wise. Then, for consumers, it&#x27;s something new, it&#x27;s fun. You get closer to the product.</p>
<p>It’s key to reduce friction.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t have to install things anymore. You download some assets in your web browser, but it&#x27;s more transparent than going into the store and searching for the app and downloading it.</p>
<p>Brands are definitely interested in WebAR for these reasons, so AR will keep growing. It brings a lot of value. You can try a car in your driveway or you can try a watch on your wrist.</p>
<p>eCommerce in a more immersive way is really the next generation for eCommerce experiences.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGx9gFHWu_4" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>When you&#x27;re building your Web AR experiences, what features does PlayCanvas provide that you think were most helpful?</strong></p>
<p>I think the true value of PlayCanvas is really how they are keeping up to date with all the WebGL standards, improving materials, improving compression, improving loading and so on. And their UI is very easy to use.</p>
<p>When you import your model, it gets converted to the GLB format. It makes it more lightweight, and you don&#x27;t need to pre-export it as GLB.</p>
<p>On the programming side, it&#x27;s just JavaScript. You can do whatever you want. It doesn&#x27;t have any preset for you aside from an orbit camera, but that&#x27;s not really important. Anyone can build more.</p>
<p><strong>Cool! So, how would you say that building an HTML5 or a WebGL experience differs from developing a native experience or a native application?</strong></p>
<p>You have to always concern yourself with the loading. In some cases, when you develop a web experience, you have to load something quickly for the user to play with right away. Then the model and the rest gets loaded progressively afterwards. Let&#x27;s say you have a car and this car has variants with different wheels, roofs, and so on. All these elements need to be loaded, but you shouldn&#x27;t load everything at once. Otherwise, the download would be huge.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s one of the main differences compared to designing a native application, aside from UX/UI, because you also need to be concerned about the browser for web experiences. Are you using it in portrait? On a desktop? Do you need to embed it into an iframe? Is it going to be full screen?</p>
<p>Those are questions that are quite different from a standalone application where you don&#x27;t need to concern yourself about the surroundings of the app.</p>
<p><strong>So next up; we went a bit over this in one of the previous questions I asked. You explained how you guys use some of the features of the editor, but is there any feature PlayCanvas provides that is the team&#x27;s favorite?</strong></p>
<p>To me it&#x27;s more that we can collaborate. The collaboration aspect of PlayCanvas is quite nice because you have one project and anyone can access it from their desktop machine on the web.</p>
<p>And you can, as an artist, populate the scene with the assets. Then, the developer can work with it. In parallel. And you can have someone to check things, maybe not edit anything, but do quality control. The collaboration aspect is one of the best features I would say that makes [PlayCanvas] so nice to work with.</p>
<p><strong>As part of the interview, but also as a feedback exercise, what is a PlayCanvas feature that would be at the top of your wishlist?</strong></p>
<p>It would be great if the PlayCanvas editor had a feature to assign different texture resolutions for different platforms (mobile or desktop), similarly to how Unity does it for different devices. It would make it so much easier to manage rather than doing it with code and tagging etc.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for sharing the feedback! Going back to another question, how do you see HTML5 and web experiences evolving over the next few years?</strong></p>
<p>I think it will grow. We see two things at the moment, WebGL experiences and cloud streaming, which is not HTML or WebGL at all. Some brands will choose either doing a WebGL configurator, or a cloud streaming configurator. Those are two different approaches. I have a tendency to prefer WebGL because you have a much more crisp image.</p>
<p>Also, once the experience is loaded, it&#x27;s much more responsive to commands. You&#x27;re not constrained by latency of streaming and video glitches. Those are things that put me off when I do classroom experiences.</p>
<p>So I think WebGL will continue, especially right now with the whole discussion around the metaverse, and when we talk about the necessary file transmission. GLTF, USDZ, USD - those files can be translated from one platform to another, so I think there&#x27;s a lot of potential for these.</p>
<p>I think the metaverse will most likely be built in WebGL rather than in cloud streaming, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Either way, I believe that in the end, it&#x27;s very important for brands to start digitizing all their assets. For example, Cartier chooses to have a WebGL viewer and recreate every single one of their products into GLB formats. I think it&#x27;s quite smart because once you have them, you can reuse them anywhere on the web; whether it&#x27;s in their website, the metaverse or a Snapchat AR filter.</p>
<p>I think there&#x27;s lots of opportunities, and as 5G expands, compression format algorithms get more efficient, things are going to be smaller and we&#x27;ll be able to build richer experiences on the web. I think there&#x27;s a long positive future, and cloud streaming is not necessarily going to replace it.</p>

<p>Hello! My name is Christina Kaliora and I’m a Games Programmer. I wrote my first line of code in September of 2016 inside PlayCanvas! I still remember that excitement when I saw my cube rotating! That’s when I said &quot;This is what I wanna do!&quot;.</p>
<p>After that, I started learning more about PlayCanvas and experimenting with other Game Engines, like Unity. Later, I attended an online coding bootcamp about web development, and since then, I work as a freelancer both for Web Development projects and web based games (using PlayCanvas).</p>
<p>Also, together with my husband and some friends we run a company called Solar Games, where we develop tools and projects for PlayCanvas.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-did-you-choose-playcanvas">Why did you choose PlayCanvas?<a href="#why-did-you-choose-playcanvas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did you choose PlayCanvas?" title="Direct link to Why did you choose PlayCanvas?">​</a></h3>
<p>PlayCanvas caught my attention from the very beginning! Some of the main reasons me and my team choose PlayCanvas:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayCanvas is one of the most powerful web based game engines out there.</li>
<li>It is the only web based game engine that has such a powerful and collaborative editor.</li>
<li>It has amazing support in the forums and discord and also, a great team to back it up!</li>
<li>It has very good performance!</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-were-the-initial-challenges-and-how-did-the-team-overcome-them">What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?<a href="#what-were-the-initial-challenges-and-how-did-the-team-overcome-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?" title="Direct link to What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?">​</a></h3>
<p>Personally, when I started, I had a very hard time getting a good grasp of PlayCanvas. There weren’t that many tutorial projects back then and since I was pretty much a newbie in coding, I had a very hard time understanding the coding concepts of game development.</p>
<p>What helped me there, was building smaller projects focused on specific areas, for example physics, player movement, raycast, UI, shaders etc. That way, I learned how to work with the API and I was able to start building larger projects/games.</p>
<p>Also, studying the engine’s code is something that any aspiring PlayCanvas developer should get into and helped me personally! Learning the inside and out of the game engine you&#x27;re using will help you tremendously!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-is-building-an-html5-gameexperience-different-from-a-native-gameexperience">How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?<a href="#how-is-building-an-html5-gameexperience-different-from-a-native-gameexperience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?" title="Direct link to How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?">​</a></h3>
<p>It is quite different in my opinion. Since things on the web work a bit differently, there are also different things that need to be taken into consideration. For example, loading times and download size are some very important things that web game devs need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>No one wants to wait over 30 seconds for a web page to load, right?</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-teams-favorite-features-of-playcanvas">What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?<a href="#what-are-the-teams-favorite-features-of-playcanvas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?" title="Direct link to What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?">​</a></h3>
<p>Favorite feature is the editor, by far. The fact that it is collaborative in real time, makes PlayCanvas the best tool for teams to work together. Also, the fact that PlayCanvas has version control integrated, is pretty cool! Something else I would add, is that PlayCanvas provides a very clean API to work with.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-on-the-feature-wishlist-for-playcanvas-this-year">What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?<a href="#what-is-on-the-feature-wishlist-for-playcanvas-this-year" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?" title="Direct link to What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?">​</a></h3>
<p>Oh, there are so many things, but I will short down my list down to three:</p>
<ul>
<li>More starter templates!</li>
<li>I would love to see the list of post processing effects growing! There isn’t something better than a web based game with nice graphics and effects. It would be great to provide developers with the tools to do so.</li>
<li>Better particle editor. We need more VFX artists in PlayCanvas!</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-you-see-html5-gamesexperiences-evolve-over-the-next-few-years">How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?<a href="#how-do-you-see-html5-gamesexperiences-evolve-over-the-next-few-years" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?" title="Direct link to How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?">​</a></h3>
<p>I think that, since the devices are becoming more and more powerful and with the webGPU on the way, web games will become more and more popular.</p>
<p>Imagine, being able to play your game both on any web browser, phone, tv without the need of downloading and installing anything? It’s mind blowing to me!</p>
<p>And now with all the Metaverse buzz I see that web based experiences are gaining more and more attention.</p>

<p>glTF (or Graphics Language Transmission Format) has become ubiquitous since its introduction in 2015. With support for advanced shading techniques, it is particularly important for graphics intensive applications like product configurators/visualizers.</p>
<p>With so many companies now relying on glTF to transmit graphics data over the web, it is critical that high quality tools are available to work with the format. This led us to develop v2.0 of our popular glTF viewer.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at what’s new.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improved-gltf-specification-support">Improved glTF Specification Support<a href="#improved-gltf-specification-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Improved glTF Specification Support" title="Direct link to Improved glTF Specification Support">​</a></h2>
<p>The glTF format is managed by the Khronos Group and defines a base specification along with a variety of extensions. The first version of the viewer supports 100% of the base spec plus the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>KHR_draco_mesh_compression</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_lights_punctual</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_clearcoat</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_unlit</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_mesh_quantization</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_texture_basisu</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_texture_transform</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The new and improved viewer released today adds support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>KHR_materials_emissive_strength</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_ior</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_sheen</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_specular</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_transmission</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_variants</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_volume</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These extensions provide developers with the ability to achieve exciting new graphical effects.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at three of them.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advanced-refraction">Advanced Refraction<a href="#advanced-refraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advanced Refraction" title="Direct link to Advanced Refraction">​</a></h2>
<p>The volume, transmission, and ior glTF extensions can simulate how light is refracted through transparent materials. This leverages PlayCanvas’ grab pass functionality to ‘grab’ and sample the back-buffer.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-ior-transmission-volume-7f15f45819c58c07c623fd2f4727af38.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Dragon with IOR, Transmission and Volume" src="/assets/images/gltf-ior-transmission-volume-7f15f45819c58c07c623fd2f4727af38.gif" width="854" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="realistic-rendering-of-fabrics">Realistic Rendering of Fabrics<a href="#realistic-rendering-of-fabrics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Realistic Rendering of Fabrics" title="Direct link to Realistic Rendering of Fabrics">​</a></h2>
<p>glTF’s sheen extension enables developers to faithfully reproduce materials with the appearance of certain fabrics. This is incredibly important for production visualization (home furnishings, apparel, vehicle interiors, and so on).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-sheen-e5df2ac676bc57464cf43898c73aaadf.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Cushion with Sheen" src="/assets/images/gltf-sheen-e5df2ac676bc57464cf43898c73aaadf.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="material-variants">Material Variants<a href="#material-variants" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Material Variants" title="Direct link to Material Variants">​</a></h2>
<p>Most product configurators allow the user to modify the appearance of a product. For example, a specific style of chair might be upholstered in various fabrics in various colors. Or a pair of shoes might be available in a number of different designs/patterns/colors.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-material-variants-7401751b03ce5d39954ac8e5dd897e89.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Sneakers with Material Variants" src="/assets/images/gltf-material-variants-7401751b03ce5d39954ac8e5dd897e89.jpg" width="1958" height="808" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>The PlayCanvas viewer now detects any material variants in the loaded scene and permits their selection in the interface.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-material-variants-fbb5909a644aa2a2c6603feff3af904b.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Material Variants in glTF Viewer" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-material-variants-fbb5909a644aa2a2c6603feff3af904b.gif" width="854" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rendering-enhancements">Rendering Enhancements<a href="#rendering-enhancements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rendering Enhancements" title="Direct link to Rendering Enhancements">​</a></h2>
<p>The new viewer introduces a couple of interesting features if you care about rendering fidelity.</p>
<p>First up is a ‘High Quality Rendering’ mode (which is a toggle in the Camera control panel).</p>
<p>Enabling this feature activates supersampling which is a type of antialiasing that aims to eliminate jagged edges along polygons. It progressively re-renders the scene many times when the camera stops, slightly offsetting and then compositing the rendered image over previous frames.</p>
<p>You can see both in action below, deliberately reduced in resolution to show the effect:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-high-quality-rendering-b12ab2c87c6aea4890b509b7066c5697.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer High Quality Mode" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-high-quality-rendering-b12ab2c87c6aea4890b509b7066c5697.gif" width="1281" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>Also new is sharper reflections for smooth reflective surfaces. The viewer will now use the full resolution skybox cubemap in the engine’s image-based lighting pipeline which looks crisp and far more realistic.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/engine-sharp-reflections-7fd16b9b17f4329d4e1f1e6cb458930a.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="High Quality Reflections" src="/assets/images/engine-sharp-reflections-7fd16b9b17f4329d4e1f1e6cb458930a.jpg" width="2200" height="1307" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interface-redesign">Interface Redesign<a href="#interface-redesign" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interface Redesign" title="Direct link to Interface Redesign">​</a></h2>
<p>Initially, all information and controls for the viewer appeared in the leftmost panel. Viewer 2.0 has been completely redesigned to more intelligently group specific areas of functionality. The leftmost panel remains but now just shows scene info and a tree view showing the loaded scene hierarchy.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-hierarchy-5192df8cc954ea9c72e6602f5fe2bd89.png" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer Left Panel" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-hierarchy-5192df8cc954ea9c72e6602f5fe2bd89.png" width="596" height="862" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>Buttons to control viewer settings can now be found at the bottom of the 3D view. These buttons open options for camera, lighting, and debug rendering (plus a fullscreen toggle).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-buttons-519dac5a0b436616cdc1a76fda3d7ba9.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer Buttons" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-buttons-519dac5a0b436616cdc1a76fda3d7ba9.gif" width="855" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>If you load a scene that contains animation, animation controls will automatically appear:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-animation-controls-21916736ec710772efa6aefd6c50bbca.png" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer Animation Controls" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-animation-controls-21916736ec710772efa6aefd6c50bbca.png" width="1128" height="310" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>The controls allow you to scrub through an animation, select playback speed, and even choose which animation clip to play should the file contain more than one.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is also now a button bottom right to download a rendered PNG of the 3D view.</p>

<p>PlayCanvas is fully committed to an open-source strategy and our glTF viewer is therefore made available to you on <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/model-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. It is a TypeScript application built on PlayCanvas <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCUI</a> front-end framework and, of course, the <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayCanvas Engine</a> runtime.</p>
<p>These open source projects have been years in the making and would not have been possible without the amazing OSS community. So why not explore our various GitHub repositories and consider making some contributions of your own. We also appreciate feature requests and bug reports, so don’t be shy!</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/model-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>FORK THE VIEWER ON GITHUB</strong></a></p>
<p>We hope you find the new and improved glTF viewer useful for your projects.

<p><a href="https://pirron.one/pool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pool Demo</a> from Solar Games using Clustered Lighting</p>
<p>The new system leverages the clustered lighting rendering algorithm and represents a significant advancement over our current lighting approach. New benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the maximum omni and spot light count to 254.</li>
<li>Improved application performance with more omni and spot lights.</li>
<li>Quick enable/disable of omni and spot lights without expensive shader recompilation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our early adopters are already using it to enhance scenes dynamically with fireflies at night, gunfire muzzle flashes, and highlighting objects in the world.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve reached a milestone where the feature is stable, and we invite you all to try it! We are eager to see how you will integrate it into your games and applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/graphics/lighting/clustered-lighting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full documentation is available</a> detailing all the features and explaining the options. Although Editor integration is still in development, we&#x27;ve created an example project linked in the documentation. This project includes a script that simplifies enabling clustered lighting, which can be copied and pasted into your own projects.</p>
<p>We plan to make clustered lighting the default system in the midterm, with the option to use the current system, as the advantages are significant. In the longer term, we aim to phase out the current lighting system to reduce engine file size, fully transitioning to clustered lighting.</p>
<p>As always, we value your feedback and would love to hear your thoughts on using the clustered lighting in the <a href="https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/clustered-lighting-open-beta-have-hundreds-of-dynamic-lights-in-your-scene/25530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum thread here</a>.</p>

<p>In 2021, we marked the 10th anniversary of PlayCanvas. In that time, we have seen WebGL become the world&#x27;s standard for web graphics, implemented into every major web browser. And we have done our part to help make WebGL content creation both easy and fun!</p>
<p>2021 was definitely our most productive year yet. The platform has continued to evolve, delivering a host of new features and performance improvements. Let&#x27;s take a look at some of the highlights:</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tools-updates">Tools Updates<a href="#tools-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tools Updates" title="Direct link to Tools Updates">​</a></h2>
<p>As you might expect, the vast majority of PlayCanvas users build their applications in the Editor. Perhaps the biggest Editor-related story this year was the release of our new <a href="https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/designer/editor-api/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Editor API</a> that allows you to automate certain operations in the Editor front-end. And this is just the first step. We will be fleshing out the Editor API further in 2022 with the goal of building a fully fledged plugin system. Stay tuned for updates on that.</p>
<p>The Code Editor also received a major upgrade this year when <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/upcoming-code-editor-upgrade-to-monaco/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we switched from CodeMirror to Monaco</a>, the text editor that powers Visual Studio Code. So if you were already a VS Code user, you should feel right at home in the new Code Editor. It brings better performance for handling large text files, better code completion, a powerful command palette and even theme selection.</p>
<p>Animation tooling also received a huge boost in 2021 with the introduction of the <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/introducing-the-anim-state-graph/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anim State Graph Editor</a>.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/animation-and-graph-53f04b3e4de1cece5835bc9e62316846.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/animation-and-graph-53f04b3e4de1cece5835bc9e62316846.gif" width="1200" height="501" class="img_ev3q"></a>AnimStateGraph Editor</p>
<p>You now have the ability to author anything from simple animation cycles to advanced locomotion systems. Check out how indie developer Cem Demir is using the new animation system in his forthcoming multiplayer survival game:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="und" dir="ltr">👀 !? <a href="https://t.co/QD2CDyAzhT">pic.twitter.com/QD2CDyAzhT</a></p>— Cem (@cemdemir) <a href="https://twitter.com/cemdemir/status/1469791447134220289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2021</a></blockquote>

<p>With all of the front-end updates to the Editor, don&#x27;t think that we have neglected the back-end! Throughout 2021, we have been diligently rebuilding the platform&#x27;s back-end to be more reliable, scalable and responsive. Users around the globe should now be experiencing Editor and Launch Page load times that are up to 50% faster. In addition, asset related jobs should now complete faster meaning you can focus on building with less time waiting.</p>
<p>Aside from the Editor, one of the coolest new tools we released this year was the <a href="https://playcanvas.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engine Examples Browser</a>. This is a coding playground for learning and experimenting with the PlayCanvas Engine API. And naturally, it&#x27;s fully open sourced on <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine/tree/dev/examples#readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
<div style="width:640px;height:360px"></div>
<p><em>Engine Examples Browser</em></p>
<p>Back in the summer, we <a href="https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/rfc-shader-editor/20616" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a> our new Node-based Shader Editor. This is a new and accessible way to build custom shaders for your PlayCanvas application.</p>
<div style="width:640px;height:360px"></div>
<p><em>Node-based Shader Editor</em></p>
<p>We&#x27;re nearing the end of the closed beta and in the coming months, we will kick off an open beta and fully open source the tool.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://playcanvas.com/viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayCanvas Viewer</a> is our open source 3D model viewer tool. In 2021, it received a number of important improvements. First up, as well as glTF files, the viewer can now also load VOX files (for voxel based scenes constructed in tools like MagicaVoxel). We also improved skeletal visualization as well as skybox handling. Check it out on <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/playcanvas-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>!</p>
<div style="width:640px;height:360px"></div>

<p>Let&#x27;s be honest - everybody loves beautifully rendered pixels. So let&#x27;s examine how PlayCanvas&#x27; graphics engine has advanced this year. First up, we have area lights that allow lights to adopt a physical shape: rectangle, circle or sphere. Later in the year, we released a preview or our new clustered lighting pipeline, which essentially increases the number of dynamic lights you can place in your scenes. With both features combined, the engine can now process clustered area lights as our <a href="https://playcanvas.github.io/#/graphics/clustered-area-lights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new engine example</a> demonstrates.</p>
<div style="width:640px;height:360px"></div>
<p><em>Clustered Area Lights</em></p>
<p>You can expect clustered lighting to fully replace the existing lighting system in early 2022 once it has been thoroughly beta-tested.</p>
<p>PlayCanvas&#x27; run-time lightmapper received a major upgrade this year. Previously, it was only able to bake direct light to lightmaps and while this could speed up scene load and render times, direct lighting alone struggles to deliver high quality visuals. Now, it can generate soft shadows and bake ambient occlusion. Check out the <a href="https://playcanvas.github.io/#/graphics/lights-baked-ao" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new engine example</a> that shows off these amazing new capabilities:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/soft-shadows-25fd9e92d5ee5652ad8acfc545626587.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/soft-shadows-25fd9e92d5ee5652ad8acfc545626587.gif" width="1920" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>Lastly, we implemented cascaded shadows maps that dramatically boosts shadow quality for large-scale environments. It didn&#x27;t take long for the community to start showcasing the benefits:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Testing the dev branch that adds support for cascaded shadow mapping in the <a href="https://twitter.com/playcanvas?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@playcanvas</a> engine, couldn&#x27;t resist😇!

<p>The PlayCanvas team are huge advocates of open source. The <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Engine runtime</a> was originally open sourced way back in <a href="https://blog.playcanvas.com/playcanvas-goes-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 2014</a>. Today, it has 6,932 stars,1,095 forks and 96 individual contributors (who we want to thank for all their incredible contributions). Simply put, PlayCanvas would not be what it is today without our amazing open source community.</p>
<p>2021 saw us double down on our open source mission with an explosion of new and updated OSS projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/editor-api" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Editor API</a> - the core functionality of the Editor</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCUI</a> and <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui-graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCUI-Graph</a> - a front-end framework for building powerful browser-based tools</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/playcanvas-observer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Observer</a> - an implementation of the observer pattern for web application development</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/playcanvas-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayCanvas Viewer</a> - a fast and lightweight 3D model viewer</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, the new Shader Editor will be joining this list in 2022. And we shall continue to open source more and more of our technology over time.</p>

<p>We already provided some hints about our 2022 roadmap. The Shader Editor makes its debut in Q1. The Editor&#x27;s Plugin System will appear later in the year. But what else?</p>
<p>PlayCanvas&#x27; glTF support will continue to advance. All remaining glTF 2.0 extensions will be implemented and we will finally release a glTF exporter (that you will be able to invoke from the Editor).</p>
<p>WebGPU, the forthcoming successor to WebGL, is also in our sights for 2022. As we continue to push the limits of 3D rendering on the web, WebGPU is a critical part of our plans. So 2022 will see us release an initial proof of concept of WebGPU support and we will share our findings with you as soon as we have them.</p>
<p>For a final peek into PlayCanvas&#x27; future, we would like to share our plan to release what we are calling the &#x27;Visual Debugger&#x27;. This tool will run in the Editor&#x27;s Launch Page. You will be able to pause the app, single step it, inspect the hierarchy and entity properties and even edit them in real-time.</p>
<p>We have so much more planned and we will publish a full 2022 public roadmap in the coming weeks. In the meantime, if you have any of your own feature requests, please do log them <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/editor/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>
<p>Have a wonderful 2022 everyone!
