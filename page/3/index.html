<p>Hey, Iâ€™m Leonidas from Solar Games (formerly known as Pirron 1)! Iâ€™ve been working with interactive 3D websites since 2012. I used to work as a civil engineer before turning my hobby and passion for gamedev into a full time job using PlayCanvas.</p>
<p>Together with doing PlayCanvas contracts of all sorts, like product configurators, games and promotional sites, Iâ€™ve been researching how to extend the PlayCanvas engine and editor. Adding open world terrains, special effects and easy to use networked controllers to match features normally found in native only game engines, led to founding Solar Games.</p>
<p>We offer Uranus Tools for PlayCanvas, a collection of plug and play scripts to supercharge your PlayCanvas creation pipeline. You can find out more about our companyâ€™s services at <a href="https://solargames.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://solargames.io</a>.</p>
<p>We are also working on <a href="https://aritelia.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aritelia</a>, a procedurally generated open world social MMO in PlayCanvas. This is still in development but you can already give it a try with the pre-alpha tech demonstration that was released last year.</p>

<p>It was actually an easy choice for us: by reviewing the mainstream WebGL libraries and platforms, PlayCanvas did stand out for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Offering an integrated editor and publishing solution. Even after all these years, the ability to easily share projects and builds and collaborate with your colleagues in real-time is something unique to PlayCanvas.</li>
<li>The PlayCanvas team is very productive and professional in the way it moves the platform forward.</li>
<li>The open source PlayCanvas engine provides a very effective and easy to use API.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-were-the-initial-challenges-and-how-did-the-team-overcome-them">What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?<a href="#what-were-the-initial-challenges-and-how-did-the-team-overcome-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?" title="Direct link to What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>The main challenge was the lack of certain features and tools. For example things that youâ€™d take for granted in a native game engine like a terrain system, post effects, automatic instancing and level of detail were missing.</p>
<p>The good news was that even before the PlayCanvas Editor API was officially released, it has always been possible to extend the PlayCanvas Editor. We were able to write our own editor extensions and quickly make them productive in our development pipeline.</p>
<p>Other developers and companies became interested in our extensions and we started offering them in our companyâ€™s asset store.</p>

<p>Several concepts like rendering, resource loading, game logic and state management are quite similar. But there are some unique concepts when it comes to web-based experiences that can be challenging.</p>
<p>In particular, download times, different display sizes and pixel ratios, a broad spectrum of device specs, and also platform and browser compatibility.</p>
<p>Taking into account these factors is mandatory when building a high-quality HTML5 experience.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-teams-favorite-features-of-playcanvas">What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?<a href="#what-are-the-teams-favorite-features-of-playcanvas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?" title="Direct link to What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Our favorite feature is the editor, by far. The fact that it is collaborative in real time makes PlayCanvas the best tool for teams to work together. Also, the fact that PlayCanvas has version control integrated is pretty cool! Something else I would add is that PlayCanvas provides a very clean API to work with. Seriously, not only HTML5 devs but also native game devs should give PlayCanvas a try. Itâ€™s a great tool to quickly be productive!</p>
<p>Other than that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Asset pipelines like enabling texture compression.</li>
<li>The engine API and the constant addition of new features by the PlayCanvas team.</li>
<li>The community - many greetings to everybody!</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Having the PlayCanvas WebGPU renderer available to play with.</li>
<li>Full support of the new node based shader editor.</li>
<li>Asset variants for specific platforms e.g. serve smaller textures on mobile.</li>
</ul>

<p>Itâ€™s definitely an exciting time for developers and companies working with HTML5 content. Both the technology has moved forward with standards and frameworks being more robust and powerful than ever, and the devices capable of running HTML5 experiences are very capable.</p>
<p>The metaverse is already leveraging HTML5 to deploy worlds and experiences across traditional web2 and newer web3 websites.</p>
<p>Pixel streaming is the only valid contender when it comes to what HTML5 can offer. I would definitely welcome a feature where pixel streaming is a viable option since itâ€™s a great concept. But right now I donâ€™t see this happening soon.</p>
<p>There are so many opportunities around HTML5 and I see a very positive future for everyone involved.</p>

<p>Welcome to the third instalment of Developer Spotlight, a series of blog articles where we talk to developers about how they use PlayCanvas and showcase the fantastic work they are doing on the Web.</p>
<p>Today we are excited to be joined by Staffan Hagberg, CMO of <a href="https://animech.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animech</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hi Staffan, welcome to Developer Spotlight! Tell us about yourself and Animech!</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.animech.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Animech</a> was founded back in 2007, in the city of Uppsala, Sweden. With a mix of 3D artists, engineers, developers, and UI/UX experts, we have a team of 40 people and all the competence in-house. The studio started in the early days of real-time 3D. It was a mix of CAD engineers and developers who realized the power of visualization for selling complex products in the life sciences segment.</p>
<p>Since then, we have visualized pretty much anything you can think of online and offline. Weâ€™ve worked in VR, AR, MR, phones, tablets, desktops, and pretty much any other device that has a browser. We have developed VR applications for cars, the first real-time 3D configurator in native WebGL ever developed, one of the world&#x27;s first configurators for Oculus Rift Devkit and much more.</p>
<p>We have also visualized experiences for hotel safes, medical instruments and lab products for 7 of the 10 largest life science companies, as well as built 3D converters from Unreal to glTF and a bunch of custom tools specially built for PlayCanvas.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.animech.com/en/articles/3d-rendering-in-realtime" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Our core business is real-time 3D</a>. We push the boundaries every day trying to invent new ways of using 3D, where our solution makes the difference.</p>
<div style="width:640px;height:360px"></div>
<p><em><a href="https://www.inr.se/planera-badrum/planera-badrum-verktyg-3d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bathroom Planner</a> for Iconic Nordic Rooms</em></p>
<p><strong>Why did Animech choose PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p>After an extensive search for a WebGL-based engine, we evaluated a few and selected PlayCanvas for its performance, out-of-the-box features, its extensibility and its valuable editor. Our customers expect the highest level of visual quality along with a smooth browsing experience - without the need for an app or plugins. PlayCanvas truly helps us deliver.</p>
<p>As for our artistsâ€™ perspective, they think it was (and still is) the most artist-friendly WebGL editor out there, with the added bonuses that it is open source, and supports many important features, such as PBR, tonemapping, render layers, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Did your team face any initial challenges? How did you overcome them?</strong></p>
<p>It&#x27;s always challenging when customers have high quality <em>and</em> performance expectations. Though, at the same time, that is what drives us. Being able to create stunning 3D experiences linked to real business value is a unique opportunity and challenge. Adding AR to that process helps you to stand out against competitors.</p>
<p>Our particular challenge was to dynamically create an AR model of a procedurally generated mesh as a generic function. Our solution was to create a SaaS service that can take of whatever 3D object youâ€™re looking at in PlayCanvas, and on the fly create AR models for both iOS and Android devices (ARKit or ARCore).</p>
<p><strong>Youâ€™ve built several Web AR experiences. Can you tell us a little about them and how important you think Web AR is today?</strong></p>
<p>We have been early adopters of both AR and VR, both as standalone applications and on the web. We believe it&#x27;s important to use AR not as a gimmick, but as an application that provides real value for the user. For example, looking at how that greenhouse would look in your actual backyard or similar. In that sense, Web AR will get more and more important, both as something that stands out but also as something that provides value for users.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/developer-spotlight-animech-fjallraven-3dea2322aee3223000e6b7bb3273a5a0.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="/assets/images/developer-spotlight-animech-fjallraven-3dea2322aee3223000e6b7bb3273a5a0.jpg" width="2560" height="1338" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p><strong>Why do you think that your clients want Web AR in their experiences?</strong></p>
<p>To offer something more to their customers - both in marketing value and actual value. To help users make smarter, more informed decisions.</p>
<p>We have also developed our own web based 3D converter that takes our PlayCanvas 3D models to glTF and USD on the fly. It is a server side solution that takes everything we develop to AR.</p>
<p><strong>How is building a web experience different from a native experience?</strong></p>
<p>You must optimize for both loading time and performance. The application could be run on a wide range of devices â€“ from several years old phones to high-end desktops.</p>
<p>The application is accessible to a wider audience since they donâ€™t need to install anything.</p>
<p><strong>What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p>As a team consisting of both 3D artists and developers, PlayCanvasâ€™ online editor provides a fantastic way to collaborate, prepare and preview our projects before pairing the solution with a stunning web UI or deploying it as a standalone viewer.</p>
<p>Our 3D artists also enjoy how the editor is robust and easy to use, and how its design promotes collaboration. Powerful material settings (per-texture UV and color channel, vertex colors, blend types, depth test/write, etc.), flexible texture compression and a fast response by the team when reporting bugs and requesting features are also great.</p>
<p><strong>What is on the feature wish list for PlayCanvas this year?</strong></p>
<p>As the future for 3D on the web continues to evolve, we are excited to see support for more accessible 3D formats, such as the glTF standard by the Khronos Group, which PlayCanvas are advocating for as well.</p>
<p>Beyond this, here are some things we look forward to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Node-based shader editor</li>
<li>Support for editor extensions</li>
<li>Post processing (HDR bloom, chromatic aberration, SSAO, motion blur, color grading, eye adaption, etc.)</li>
<li>More customizable asset import options</li>
<li>Reflection probes</li>
<li>Material instances (see Unreal Engine)</li>
<li>Debug visualization (see Unreal Engineâ€™s View Modes)</li>
<li>Expose currently hidden options in the editor (detail maps, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you see AR and 3D e-commerce evolve over the next few years?</strong></p>
<p>The possibilities are enormous. The question is when do people actually start using AR. It has been around for many years, lots of interesting solutions and demos have been built, but the real value of AR has not reached the masses yet.</p>
<p>I think we are closing in on that though. Just the other day I was about to buy a new espresso coffee machine. One supplier had an AR model online in the e-store with which I could see that it looked good and covered my needs. With just one static USDZ file. It is such an easy way of helping your customer to make the right decision. Imagine how much value you add if you can see configured 3D models in AR and really see the potential of what you are about to buy.</p>
<p>Next phase would be to configure and change your 3D model directly in AR-mode which would make the experience even stronger.</p>
<p>As the graphics quality gets better and better online and the fashion industry keeps on digitizing their customer journey, AR will probably be the best and easiest way of trying on fashion products like bags, watches, jewelry and clothes. It will reduce faulty orders on a massive scale if you can do a virtual fitting before buying stuff online.</p>
<p>Animech helps our customers to get what they want. Simply put: we empower people to make smart decisions through intelligent visualization.</p>

<p>Today weâ€™re excited to announce the next major release of our glTF viewer. This version makes the viewer an ideal tool for reviewing how glTF models render on mobile as well as in augmented reality!</p>
<p><a href="https://playcanvas.com/viewer/?load=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KhronosGroup/glTF-Sample-Models/master/2.0/DamagedHelmet/glTF-Binary/DamagedHelmet.glb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TRY IT NOW</strong></a></p>

<p>Once a model has been loaded into the viewer on mobile, youâ€™ll be given the option to drop into an augmented reality experience. The mode you get currently differs based on the operating system youâ€™re using.</p>
<div style="display:flex;justify-content:space-between;margin-bottom:15px"><img src="/img/gltf-viewer-mobile-ar-ios.gif" style="width:49%" alt="glTF Viewer AR on iOS"><img src="/img/gltf-viewer-mobile-ar-android.gif" style="width:49%" alt="glTF Viewer AR on Android"></div>
<p><em>Quick Look mode on iOS (left) and WebXR mode on Android (right)</em></p>
<p>On iOS, the model will be loaded with Appleâ€™s AR Quick Look mode (above left), while on Android the model will be placed into your environment using WebXR (above right).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s now possible to verify the content and rendering of your assets no matter which device youâ€™re working on. The viewer has been redesigned using mobile-first principles, so you can explore glTF content just as well on mobile as you can on desktop. The UI scales up or down depending on the device screen size and takes an uncluttered approach to ensure you can focus on the glTF content itself even on very small screens.</p>

<p>The latest release of <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui/releases/tag/v2.7.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCUI (v2.7.0)</a> enables the use of additional themes in applications built using it. This allowed us to apply a new color theme to the model-viewer:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-new-theme-8f3ac278243abafe89779d29ee824716.png" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="New PCUI Theme" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-new-theme-8f3ac278243abafe89779d29ee824716.png" width="3456" height="1936" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>The new muted gray tones of this theme should allow users to more readily focus on their model content. Over the coming months, youâ€™ll begin to see this new theme applied to more applications in the PlayCanvas ecosystem! Be sure to pass any feedback onto us using the <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issue tracker</a> of the PCUI library.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="open-source">Open Source<a href="#open-source" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Open Source" title="Direct link to Open Source">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>PlayCanvas is fully committed to an open source strategy and our glTF viewer is therefore made available to you on <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/model-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. It is a TypeScript application built on PlayCanvas <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCUI</a> front-end framework and, of course, the <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayCanvas Engine</a> runtime.</p>
<p>These open source projects have been years in the making and would not have been possible without the amazing OSS community. So why not explore our various GitHub repositories and consider making some contributions of your own. We also appreciate feature requests and bug reports, so donâ€™t be shy!</p>

<p>Welcome to the second installment of Developer Spotlight! A series of blog articles where we talk to developers about how they use PlayCanvas and showcase the fantastic work they are doing on the Web.</p>
<p>Today we are excited to be joined by Frantz Lasorne, co-founder of <a href="https://www.vz777.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visionaries777</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Hi! Let&#x27;s get started. Firstly, welcome to the developer spotlight! Frantz, if you could just tell me a little bit about yourself and your team and your studio.</strong></p>
<p>My name is Frantz and I&#x27;m the co-founder of Visionaries777. Actually, we [founders] are three. We started as two French guys. We studied together in France; Interaction Design, and then we created this company about 10 years ago in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>[We currently employ] Around 35 people. We&#x27;ve been working on AR since 2010. It&#x27;s our main focus. Within the realm of AR, we are involved in 3D real time AR, and all sorts of XR applications.</p>
<p>Me and my business partner were working at Lego in Denmark before, so we started to work on AR back then in the R&amp;D department. We helped Lego bridge the physical and digital to create hybrid play experiences.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we left Lego and started our own company. Lego hired us as consultants to keep working for them for some time. In the early days, we did a lot of collaborations for marketing and promotional events using AR.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the things we work on are more industrial-focused; automotive or luxury. AR is now a properly matured product, with WebGL, Web AR experiences, VR and so on.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnoiJA7UCiY" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>Thank you! I&#x27;m curious, why did Visionaries777 choose PlayCanvas?</strong></p>
<p>Before, we always used Unity 3D for any 3D real time project, because they have a huge compatibility of hardware platforms. It&#x27;s quite nice. The only platform they are lacking is the web.</p>
<p>We were looking around, trying to find what is the best platform to develop WebGL experiences. Then, we saw PlayCanvas, opened the editor, and were surprised how familiar it was for us. I think the people who designed the PlayCanvas editor knew Unity and got inspired in terms of the menu and layout. It&#x27;s very similar to the way [Unity] works. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s an editor on the web rather than a desktop application. So for us, it was very easy to do the jump.</p>
<p>So far we&#x27;ve been really happy with all the engine capabilities, the loading, how lightweight it is, et cetera. For us, it&#x27;s the best platform for developing web experiences.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/v777-husqvarna-f2011d5a97b9b1526426d5ffe8680bd7.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Husqvarna" src="/assets/images/v777-husqvarna-f2011d5a97b9b1526426d5ffe8680bd7.jpg" width="1600" height="884" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p><strong>Awesome! So, were there any initial challenges that you guys faced? How did you guys end up overcoming them?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of challenges? I think mostly the model optimizations; how to get the WebGL experience as small as possible, but retaining maximum visual quality. Most of our clients are either automotive brands or luxury brands, so they are concerned about the product that you are looking at on the screen. It&#x27;s pointless to show a product that you can see the rough edges of. They won&#x27;t like it in the end.</p>
<p>That was our struggle at the beginning - to try and find the right balance of optimizing enough, but not too much, and be happy with loading time. So it took some trying to get this right and find the right compromise.</p>
<p>Right now, with our current approach and the tools in our pipeline, weâ€™re quite happy. And it&#x27;s also why we work with Cartier and are now doing all these products on their websites.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/v777-watch-b7181b8c2875451ece01769fe017f514.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Watch" src="/assets/images/v777-watch-b7181b8c2875451ece01769fe017f514.jpg" width="1600" height="884" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p><strong>That&#x27;s very interesting. Visionaries777 has worked on several Web AR experiences. Can you tell me how important you think Web AR is today?</strong></p>
<p>It&#x27;s very important - but we are back to the same problem that we had in the early 2010s, when we relied on markers for tracking. Now with where we are in WebAR we are still very limited. You need something like an image marker, or a floor with a world target, but it&#x27;s not as stable as if you use AR Kit or AR Core in a native Unity app.</p>
<p>With a standalone Unity application with ARKit and ARCore it&#x27;s mind blowing what you can do. There&#x27;s barely any drift, it&#x27;s super accurate. With web you&#x27;re still constrained. Tracking is not perfect. There&#x27;s a lot of drift. So I think the applications we see with the present state of tech are limited, experiences are considered a bit gimmicky. It&#x27;s getting there, but it still needs to grow.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day, for marketing initiatives, no one wants to install an ad app on their smartphone as a user, as a consumer. You don&#x27;t want to install a BMW app just to uninstall it three days later because you&#x27;re done playing around.</p>
<p>These sorts of experiences were fine 10 years ago on an iPhone, but now people have moved on, and have different mindsets - things should be accessible through a web browser directly, not through an app. If it&#x27;s inside an app, it has to be inside Snapchat, inside Instagram, or inside an app that has more to it than just one AR experience.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/v777-bmw-80445262e2e58a12dbc7e8d94e893ff0.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="BMW" src="/assets/images/v777-bmw-80445262e2e58a12dbc7e8d94e893ff0.jpg" width="1024" height="563" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p><strong>Extending a bit from that question, why do you think that the clients you work with want Web AR in their experiences?</strong></p>
<p>Augmented reality has always been exciting for brands to show a product in 3D and also integrate it into [customersâ€™] homes or their driveway. Itâ€™s quite appealing for a brand, marketing-wise. Then, for consumers, it&#x27;s something new, it&#x27;s fun. You get closer to the product.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s key to reduce friction.</p>
<p>You don&#x27;t have to install things anymore. You download some assets in your web browser, but it&#x27;s more transparent than going into the store and searching for the app and downloading it.</p>
<p>Brands are definitely interested in WebAR for these reasons, so AR will keep growing. It brings a lot of value. You can try a car in your driveway or you can try a watch on your wrist.</p>
<p>eCommerce in a more immersive way is really the next generation for eCommerce experiences.</p>
<div class="iframe-container"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eGx9gFHWu_4" title="YouTube video player" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"></iframe></div>
<p><strong>When you&#x27;re building your Web AR experiences, what features does PlayCanvas provide that you think were most helpful?</strong></p>
<p>I think the true value of PlayCanvas is really how they are keeping up to date with all the WebGL standards, improving materials, improving compression, improving loading and so on. And their UI is very easy to use.</p>
<p>When you import your model, it gets converted to the GLB format. It makes it more lightweight, and you don&#x27;t need to pre-export it as GLB.</p>
<p>On the programming side, it&#x27;s just JavaScript. You can do whatever you want. It doesn&#x27;t have any preset for you aside from an orbit camera, but that&#x27;s not really important. Anyone can build more.</p>
<p><strong>Cool! So, how would you say that building an HTML5 or a WebGL experience differs from developing a native experience or a native application?</strong></p>
<p>You have to always concern yourself with the loading. In some cases, when you develop a web experience, you have to load something quickly for the user to play with right away. Then the model and the rest gets loaded progressively afterwards. Let&#x27;s say you have a car and this car has variants with different wheels, roofs, and so on. All these elements need to be loaded, but you shouldn&#x27;t load everything at once. Otherwise, the download would be huge.</p>
<p>I think that&#x27;s one of the main differences compared to designing a native application, aside from UX/UI, because you also need to be concerned about the browser for web experiences. Are you using it in portrait? On a desktop? Do you need to embed it into an iframe? Is it going to be full screen?</p>
<p>Those are questions that are quite different from a standalone application where you don&#x27;t need to concern yourself about the surroundings of the app.</p>
<p><strong>So next up; we went a bit over this in one of the previous questions I asked. You explained how you guys use some of the features of the editor, but is there any feature PlayCanvas provides that is the team&#x27;s favorite?</strong></p>
<p>To me it&#x27;s more that we can collaborate. The collaboration aspect of PlayCanvas is quite nice because you have one project and anyone can access it from their desktop machine on the web.</p>
<p>And you can, as an artist, populate the scene with the assets. Then, the developer can work with it. In parallel. And you can have someone to check things, maybe not edit anything, but do quality control. The collaboration aspect is one of the best features I would say that makes [PlayCanvas] so nice to work with.</p>
<p><strong>As part of the interview, but also as a feedback exercise, what is a PlayCanvas feature that would be at the top of your wishlist?</strong></p>
<p>It would be great if the PlayCanvas editor had a feature to assign different texture resolutions for different platforms (mobile or desktop), similarly to how Unity does it for different devices. It would make it so much easier to manage rather than doing it with code and tagging etc.</p>
<p><strong>Thanks for sharing the feedback! Going back to another question, how do you see HTML5 and web experiences evolving over the next few years?</strong></p>
<p>I think it will grow. We see two things at the moment, WebGL experiences and cloud streaming, which is not HTML or WebGL at all. Some brands will choose either doing a WebGL configurator, or a cloud streaming configurator. Those are two different approaches. I have a tendency to prefer WebGL because you have a much more crisp image.</p>
<p>Also, once the experience is loaded, it&#x27;s much more responsive to commands. You&#x27;re not constrained by latency of streaming and video glitches. Those are things that put me off when I do classroom experiences.</p>
<p>So I think WebGL will continue, especially right now with the whole discussion around the metaverse, and when we talk about the necessary file transmission. GLTF, USDZ, USD - those files can be translated from one platform to another, so I think there&#x27;s a lot of potential for these.</p>
<p>I think the metaverse will most likely be built in WebGL rather than in cloud streaming, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>Either way, I believe that in the end, it&#x27;s very important for brands to start digitizing all their assets. For example, Cartier chooses to have a WebGL viewer and recreate every single one of their products into GLB formats. I think it&#x27;s quite smart because once you have them, you can reuse them anywhere on the web; whether it&#x27;s in their website, the metaverse or a Snapchat AR filter.</p>
<p>I think there&#x27;s lots of opportunities, and as 5G expands, compression format algorithms get more efficient, things are going to be smaller and we&#x27;ll be able to build richer experiences on the web. I think there&#x27;s a long positive future, and cloud streaming is not necessarily going to replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you! Those were all the questions I had. Thank you for your time, Frantz! Is there anything that you would like to promote, a website, a Twitter handle, or a job opening that you would like to share?</strong></p>

<p>Hello! My name is Christina Kaliora and Iâ€™m a Games Programmer. I wrote my first line of code in September of 2016 inside PlayCanvas! I still remember that excitement when I saw my cube rotating! Thatâ€™s when I said &quot;This is what I wanna do!&quot;.</p>
<p>After that, I started learning more about PlayCanvas and experimenting with other Game Engines, like Unity. Later, I attended an online coding bootcamp about web development, and since then, I work as a freelancer both for Web Development projects and web based games (using PlayCanvas).</p>
<p>Also, together with my husband and some friends we run a company called Solar Games, where we develop tools and projects for PlayCanvas.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-did-you-choose-playcanvas">Why did you choose PlayCanvas?<a href="#why-did-you-choose-playcanvas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why did you choose PlayCanvas?" title="Direct link to Why did you choose PlayCanvas?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>PlayCanvas caught my attention from the very beginning! Some of the main reasons me and my team choose PlayCanvas:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayCanvas is one of the most powerful web based game engines out there.</li>
<li>It is the only web based game engine that has such a powerful and collaborative editor.</li>
<li>It has amazing support in the forums and discord and also, a great team to back it up!</li>
<li>It has very good performance!</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-were-the-initial-challenges-and-how-did-the-team-overcome-them">What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?<a href="#what-were-the-initial-challenges-and-how-did-the-team-overcome-them" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?" title="Direct link to What were the initial challenges and how did the team overcome them?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Personally, when I started, I had a very hard time getting a good grasp of PlayCanvas. There werenâ€™t that many tutorial projects back then and since I was pretty much a newbie in coding, I had a very hard time understanding the coding concepts of game development.</p>
<p>What helped me there, was building smaller projects focused on specific areas, for example physics, player movement, raycast, UI, shaders etc. That way, I learned how to work with the API and I was able to start building larger projects/games.</p>
<p>Also, studying the engineâ€™s code is something that any aspiring PlayCanvas developer should get into and helped me personally! Learning the inside and out of the game engine you&#x27;re using will help you tremendously!</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-is-building-an-html5-gameexperience-different-from-a-native-gameexperience">How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?<a href="#how-is-building-an-html5-gameexperience-different-from-a-native-gameexperience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?" title="Direct link to How is building an HTML5 game/experience different from a native game/experience?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>It is quite different in my opinion. Since things on the web work a bit differently, there are also different things that need to be taken into consideration. For example, loading times and download size are some very important things that web game devs need to pay attention to.</p>
<p>No one wants to wait over 30 seconds for a web page to load, right?</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-are-the-teams-favorite-features-of-playcanvas">What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?<a href="#what-are-the-teams-favorite-features-of-playcanvas" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?" title="Direct link to What are the team&#x27;s favorite features of PlayCanvas?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Favorite feature is the editor, by far. The fact that it is collaborative in real time, makes PlayCanvas the best tool for teams to work together. Also, the fact that PlayCanvas has version control integrated, is pretty cool! Something else I would add, is that PlayCanvas provides a very clean API to work with.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-on-the-feature-wishlist-for-playcanvas-this-year">What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?<a href="#what-is-on-the-feature-wishlist-for-playcanvas-this-year" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?" title="Direct link to What is on the feature wishlist for PlayCanvas this year?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Oh, there are so many things, but I will short down my list down to three:</p>
<ul>
<li>More starter templates!</li>
<li>I would love to see the list of post processing effects growing! There isnâ€™t something better than a web based game with nice graphics and effects. It would be great to provide developers with the tools to do so.</li>
<li>Better particle editor. We need more VFX artists in PlayCanvas!</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-you-see-html5-gamesexperiences-evolve-over-the-next-few-years">How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?<a href="#how-do-you-see-html5-gamesexperiences-evolve-over-the-next-few-years" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?" title="Direct link to How do you see HTML5 games/experiences evolve over the next few years?">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>I think that, since the devices are becoming more and more powerful and with the webGPU on the way, web games will become more and more popular.</p>
<p>Imagine, being able to play your game both on any web browser, phone, tv without the need of downloading and installing anything? Itâ€™s mind blowing to me!</p>
<p>And now with all the Metaverse buzz I see that web based experiences are gaining more and more attention.</p>

<p>Today, we are excited to announce the 2.0 release of our glTF viewer.</p>
<p><a href="https://playcanvas.com/viewer?load=https://s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/static.playcanvas.com/models/IridescentDishWithOlives.glb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>TRY IT NOW</strong></a></p>
<p>glTF (or Graphics Language Transmission Format) has become ubiquitous since its introduction in 2015. With support for advanced shading techniques, it is particularly important for graphics intensive applications like product configurators/visualizers.</p>
<p>With so many companies now relying on glTF to transmit graphics data over the web, it is critical that high quality tools are available to work with the format. This led us to develop v2.0 of our popular glTF viewer.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a closer look at whatâ€™s new.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="improved-gltf-specification-support">Improved glTF Specification Support<a href="#improved-gltf-specification-support" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Improved glTF Specification Support" title="Direct link to Improved glTF Specification Support">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The glTF format is managed by the Khronos Group and defines a base specification along with a variety of extensions. The first version of the viewer supports 100% of the base spec plus the following extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>KHR_draco_mesh_compression</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_lights_punctual</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_clearcoat</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_unlit</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_mesh_quantization</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_texture_basisu</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_texture_transform</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The new and improved viewer released today adds support for:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>KHR_materials_emissive_strength</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_ior</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_sheen</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_specular</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_transmission</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_variants</code></li>
<li><code>KHR_materials_volume</code></li>
</ul>
<p>These extensions provide developers with the ability to achieve exciting new graphical effects.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s take a look at three of them.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="advanced-refraction">Advanced Refraction<a href="#advanced-refraction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Advanced Refraction" title="Direct link to Advanced Refraction">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The volume, transmission, and ior glTF extensions can simulate how light is refracted through transparent materials. This leverages PlayCanvasâ€™ grab pass functionality to â€˜grabâ€™ and sample the back-buffer.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-ior-transmission-volume-7f15f45819c58c07c623fd2f4727af38.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Dragon with IOR, Transmission and Volume" src="/assets/images/gltf-ior-transmission-volume-7f15f45819c58c07c623fd2f4727af38.gif" width="854" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="realistic-rendering-of-fabrics">Realistic Rendering of Fabrics<a href="#realistic-rendering-of-fabrics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Realistic Rendering of Fabrics" title="Direct link to Realistic Rendering of Fabrics">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>glTFâ€™s sheen extension enables developers to faithfully reproduce materials with the appearance of certain fabrics. This is incredibly important for production visualization (home furnishings, apparel, vehicle interiors, and so on).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-sheen-e5df2ac676bc57464cf43898c73aaadf.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Cushion with Sheen" src="/assets/images/gltf-sheen-e5df2ac676bc57464cf43898c73aaadf.jpg" width="400" height="300" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="material-variants">Material Variants<a href="#material-variants" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Material Variants" title="Direct link to Material Variants">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Most product configurators allow the user to modify the appearance of a product. For example, a specific style of chair might be upholstered in various fabrics in various colors. Or a pair of shoes might be available in a number of different designs/patterns/colors.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-material-variants-7401751b03ce5d39954ac8e5dd897e89.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Sneakers with Material Variants" src="/assets/images/gltf-material-variants-7401751b03ce5d39954ac8e5dd897e89.jpg" width="1958" height="808" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>The PlayCanvas viewer now detects any material variants in the loaded scene and permits their selection in the interface.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-material-variants-fbb5909a644aa2a2c6603feff3af904b.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Material Variants in glTF Viewer" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-material-variants-fbb5909a644aa2a2c6603feff3af904b.gif" width="854" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rendering-enhancements">Rendering Enhancements<a href="#rendering-enhancements" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rendering Enhancements" title="Direct link to Rendering Enhancements">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>The new viewer introduces a couple of interesting features if you care about rendering fidelity.</p>
<p>First up is a â€˜High Quality Renderingâ€™ mode (which is a toggle in the Camera control panel).</p>
<p>Enabling this feature activates supersampling which is a type of antialiasing that aims to eliminate jagged edges along polygons. It progressively re-renders the scene many times when the camera stops, slightly offsetting and then compositing the rendered image over previous frames.</p>
<p>You can see both in action below, deliberately reduced in resolution to show the effect:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-high-quality-rendering-b12ab2c87c6aea4890b509b7066c5697.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer High Quality Mode" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-high-quality-rendering-b12ab2c87c6aea4890b509b7066c5697.gif" width="1281" height="720" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>Also new is sharper reflections for smooth reflective surfaces. The viewer will now use the full resolution skybox cubemap in the engineâ€™s image-based lighting pipeline which looks crisp and far more realistic.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/engine-sharp-reflections-7fd16b9b17f4329d4e1f1e6cb458930a.jpg" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="High Quality Reflections" src="/assets/images/engine-sharp-reflections-7fd16b9b17f4329d4e1f1e6cb458930a.jpg" width="2200" height="1307" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="interface-redesign">Interface Redesign<a href="#interface-redesign" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Interface Redesign" title="Direct link to Interface Redesign">â€‹</a></h2>
<p>Initially, all information and controls for the viewer appeared in the leftmost panel. Viewer 2.0 has been completely redesigned to more intelligently group specific areas of functionality. The leftmost panel remains but now just shows scene info and a tree view showing the loaded scene hierarchy.</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-hierarchy-5192df8cc954ea9c72e6602f5fe2bd89.png" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer Left Panel" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-hierarchy-5192df8cc954ea9c72e6602f5fe2bd89.png" width="596" height="862" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>Buttons to control viewer settings can now be found at the bottom of the 3D view. These buttons open options for camera, lighting, and debug rendering (plus a fullscreen toggle).</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-buttons-519dac5a0b436616cdc1a76fda3d7ba9.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer Buttons" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-buttons-519dac5a0b436616cdc1a76fda3d7ba9.gif" width="855" height="480" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>If you load a scene that contains animation, animation controls will automatically appear:</p>
<p><a href="/assets/files/gltf-viewer-animation-controls-21916736ec710772efa6aefd6c50bbca.png" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="glTF Viewer Animation Controls" src="/assets/images/gltf-viewer-animation-controls-21916736ec710772efa6aefd6c50bbca.png" width="1128" height="310" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p>The controls allow you to scrub through an animation, select playback speed, and even choose which animation clip to play should the file contain more than one.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is also now a button bottom right to download a rendered PNG of the 3D view.</p>

<p>PlayCanvas is fully committed to an open-source strategy and our glTF viewer is therefore made available to you on <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/model-viewer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>. It is a TypeScript application built on PlayCanvas <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/pcui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PCUI</a> front-end framework and, of course, the <a href="https://github.com/playcanvas/engine" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayCanvas Engine</a> runtime.</p>
<p>These open source projects have been years in the making and would not have been possible without the amazing OSS community. So why not explore our various GitHub repositories and consider making some contributions of your own. We also appreciate feature requests and bug reports, so donâ€™t be shy!</p>

<p><a href="/assets/files/pirron-pool-3869caf31b9a503a9979baf426590c1f.gif" target="_blank"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Pirron Pool" src="/assets/images/pirron-pool-3869caf31b9a503a9979baf426590c1f.gif" width="570" height="320" class="img_ev3q"></a></p>
<p><a href="https://pirron.one/pool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pool Demo</a> from Solar Games using Clustered Lighting</p>
<p>The new system leverages the clustered lighting rendering algorithm and represents a significant advancement over our current lighting approach. New benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the maximum omni and spot light count to 254.</li>
<li>Improved application performance with more omni and spot lights.</li>
<li>Quick enable/disable of omni and spot lights without expensive shader recompilation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of our early adopters are already using it to enhance scenes dynamically with fireflies at night, gunfire muzzle flashes, and highlighting objects in the world.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve reached a milestone where the feature is stable, and we invite you all to try it! We are eager to see how you will integrate it into your games and applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.playcanvas.com/user-manual/graphics/lighting/clustered-lighting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Full documentation is available</a> detailing all the features and explaining the options. Although Editor integration is still in development, we&#x27;ve created an example project linked in the documentation. This project includes a script that simplifies enabling clustered lighting, which can be copied and pasted into your own projects.</p>
<p>We plan to make clustered lighting the default system in the midterm, with the option to use the current system, as the advantages are significant. In the longer term, we aim to phase out the current lighting system to reduce engine file size, fully transitioning to clustered lighting.</p>
<p>As always, we value your feedback and would love to hear your thoughts on using the clustered lighting in the <a href="https://forum.playcanvas.com/t/clustered-lighting-open-beta-have-hundreds-of-dynamic-lights-in-your-scene/25530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum thread here</a>.</p>
